# defold-cairo
A Cairo based UI for use with Defold

## Status
Currently in development. Many components to be cleaned up and improved.
It is usable, but it can break if not used properly. 

API for cairo is highly simplified and a UI widget system is available. 
Currently the cairo system needs to be relied upon prebuilt shared libraries for the target platform. This will be moved to native building in the near future to maximise cross platform usage.
